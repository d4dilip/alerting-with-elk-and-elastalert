# Alerting with ELK and Elastalert
Configuration for article on alerting with the ELK stack and Elastalert.
The article can be found here:

This configuration has been modified since the article was written as to work in a Linux environment. Also verified in a Mac OS X environment with Docker for Mac. Will need changes if you are to use the old Docker Toolbox for Mac.
